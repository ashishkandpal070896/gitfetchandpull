      Git Pull and Git Fetch are both commands used to update a local repository with changes from a remote repository, but they operate differently. Git Fetch retrieves the latest changes from the remote repository and stores them in the local repository without merging them into the current branch. This allows you to review the changes before integrating them. On the other hand, Git Pull is a combination of Git Fetch and Git Merge; it fetches the changes from the remote repository and immediately merges them into the current branch. This means that Git Pull updates your local branch with the latest changes in one step, while Git Fetch gives you more control over when and how to integrate those changes.
